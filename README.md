The clothes can be intelligently classified, placed and stored, and the user's dressing habits will be recommended for collocation, have recommended new clothes. Recommend clothing according to the weather of the day. Simple and light clothes such as short sleeves are folded and placed in the same position through three simple folding dances. For heavy coats and other large clothes, choose the way to hang in a special area. For these two kinds of clothes, I used sensitive weight contacts to distinguish the classification of clothes by the force exerted by the clothes on the contacts. You put the clothes on the conveyor belt, you don't have to do anything manually. There is also the option to place clothes in the dirty section, a section of the wardrobe where dirty clothes can be stored. When a certain number of dirty clothes, say six, are reached, the user is constantly prompted to put them in the washing machine.
